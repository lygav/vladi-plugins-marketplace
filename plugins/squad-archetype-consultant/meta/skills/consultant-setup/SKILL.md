# Consultant Setup Wizard

You are configuring a **consultant archetype** team. This skill runs after the core federation setup has installed the consultant archetype plugin. Core config (description, MCP stack, telemetry) is already in `federate.config.json` — don't touch it. Your job is to collect archetype-specific settings and write them to the team's `.squad/archetype-config.json`.

## Triggers

- "configure consultant"
- "consultant setup"
- "set up consultant team"

## Prerequisites

Before asking questions, verify:

```bash
test -f federate.config.json
```

If missing:

> "No federation config found. Run the federation setup first — say **'set up federation'** to start."

## Configuration Questions

Walk through these questions to collect archetype-specific settings:

### Question 1: Domain Coverage

Ask:

> "What domain or codebase will this consultant cover? (e.g., 'authentication system', 'payment APIs', 'infrastructure documentation')"

Capture: `domain` — The specific area of expertise

### Question 2: Codebase Location

Ask:

> "Where is the codebase or documentation set?
> - Provide a repository URL (e.g., 'https://github.com/org/repo')
> - Local path (e.g., '/path/to/codebase')
> - Documentation URL (e.g., 'https://docs.example.com')"

Capture: `codebaseLocation` — Where the consultant indexes knowledge from

### Question 3: Question Types

Ask:

> "What kinds of questions should this consultant handle? (select all that apply)
> - Architecture and design decisions
> - API usage and integration patterns
> - Debugging and troubleshooting
> - Code conventions and best practices
> - Other (specify)"

Capture: `questionTypes` — Array of question categories

### Question 4: Indexing Depth

Ask:

> "How deep should the initial indexing go?
> - **surface**: Quick overview, key files only (~5-10 min)
> - **moderate**: Core functionality and patterns (~15-30 min)
> - **deep**: Comprehensive analysis with edge cases (~1+ hour)"

Capture: `indexingDepth` — Controls how much time is spent on initial analysis

### Question 5: Proactive Mode

Ask:

> "Should the consultant proactively share insights when it discovers important patterns, or only answer when asked?"

Capture: `proactiveInsights` — Boolean flag for unsolicited knowledge sharing

## Write Configuration

After collecting settings, write to `.squad/archetype-config.json`:

```json
{
  "archetype": "consultant",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "settings": {
    "domain": "<collected>",
    "codebaseLocation": "<collected>",
    "questionTypes": ["<collected>"],
    "indexingDepth": "<surface|moderate|deep>",
    "proactiveInsights": false
  }
}
```

Confirm:

> "✅ Consultant archetype configured! Teams can now be onboarded with `npx tsx scripts/onboard.ts`"
